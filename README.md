# dogmeat.nvim

Dogmeat is an all-in-one AI companion for Neovim.

Not the smartest tool in the shed, but:
- It stays out of your way and helps when called.
- It loves fetching quests.
- It never judge you.
- Good boy.

__An homage to the most iconic Fallout's companion 🐕__

## Features

- AI-powered code completion using [aichat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat)
- Highly customizable
    - Roles: to predefine context for code completion
    - Macros: for automating repetitive tasks
- AI agents for most common code agents like codex, claude, opencode, crush, etc.

## WIP

This is a working in progress. I still don't know the end goal of the project I just want to structure the way I use AI and AI agents in Neovim.
